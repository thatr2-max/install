            <h2>Property Taxes</h2>
            <p>Property taxes fund essential city services including schools, public safety, roads, and parks.</p>

            <h3>Current Tax Rate</h3>
            <p><strong>FY 2025 Tax Rate:</strong> $1.25 per $100 of assessed value</p>

            <h3>How Property Taxes Are Calculated</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Property is assessed by the County Assessor</li>
                <li>Assessment is multiplied by the tax rate</li>
                <li>Exemptions and deductions are applied</li>
                <li>Final tax amount is determined</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>Example Calculation</h4>
                <p><strong>Assessed Value:</strong> $200,000</p>
